 @abstract   Provides a nub that ApplePS2Controller can attach to
 @discussion
 The ApplePS2Controller driver is written to the nub provided by the
 AppleI386PlatformExpert class which exposes the controller as it is found
 on a legacy x86 machine.
 
 To make that kext work on an ACPI machine, a nub providing the same
 service must exist.  Previous releases of the official ACPI PE included
 this class.  Newer release do not.  This implementation is intended
 to be fully ABI compatible with the one Apple used to provide.
